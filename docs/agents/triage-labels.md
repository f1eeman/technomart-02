# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This file maps those
roles to the actual strings used in this repo's issue tracker.

This repo uses a local-markdown tracker, so a "label" is the value of the
`Status:` line near the top of an issue file — not a GitHub label.

| Label in mattpocock/skills | `Status:` value in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`             | `needs-triage`                 | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`               | `needs-info`                   | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`          | `ready-for-agent`              | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human`          | `ready-for-human`              | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`                  | `wontfix`                      | Will not be actioned                     |

When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the AFK-ready triage label"), write the
corresponding value into the issue file's `Status:` line.

Edit the right-hand column to match whatever vocabulary you actually use.

## Local addition: `done`

| `Status:` value | Meaning                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------ |
| `done`          | Implemented and accepted |

The five canonical roles describe **who an issue is addressed to**, not whether it
is finished — so implemented issues used to keep the label they were triaged with,
which reads as outstanding work. `done` closes that gap.

Two rules keep it from colliding with the skills:

- **It is an addition, not a rename.** The five strings above stay exactly as they
  are; no skill's vocabulary changes.
- **Only a human sets it, at acceptance.** No skill writes `done`, and none looks
  for it — an issue marked `done` simply matches no skill's query, which is the
  intended behaviour.

Applied from the `feature-section` directory onward. Earlier directories keep the
label they were triaged with; relabelling them retroactively is a separate call.
